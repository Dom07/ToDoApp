# ToDoApp

Hello, welcome to this repository. I have been working on developing a simple Todo app in android studio. 
This is my first go towards developing an android app. This app is very basic that allows the user to add a new task,
assign it a deadline by providing date and time and insert some usefull tags (which will be used for filtering task
in the future, yet to be implemented). When a task is complete the user can assign it a check mark after which the 
app will be moved to the completed task list. From the completed task list he can delete the task permanently or he 
can restore it by providing new deadline. Insights for the completed task can be seen in the 
insight section (yet to be implemented).
This app makes use of SQlite for storing data.

Thank you.
